1.  Project Summary
    This project aims at building a travel application using 3 APIs.The project will include a simple form where you enter the location you are traveling to and the date you are leaving. If the trip is within a week, you will get the current weather forecast. If the trip is in the future, you will get a predicted forecast. Weatherbit API takes in coordinates for weather data from the Geonames API. Once we have all of this data, weâ€™ll want to display an image of the location entered using the Pixabay API.
